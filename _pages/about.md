I am a PhD student at the Postgraduate Program in Sociology (PPGS/FAFICH) at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil. My work is situated within the **Sociology of Knowledge and Science**, focusing on how scientific dissemination is perceived and practiced by the scientific community.

## Research Interests
My research, supervised by Prof. Yurij Castelfranchi, explores:
* **Public Communication of Science and Technology (PCST):** Perceptions of scientists and institutional policies.
* **Sociology of Science:** The relationship between science, technology, and society.
* **Lusophone Scientific Landscapes:** Comparative analysis of scientific dissemination in Portuguese-speaking countries.

## Professional Experience
Since 2017, I have served as the **Executive Secretary** at the **Directorate of Scientific Dissemination (DDC)** at UFMG. My responsibilities include:
* Coordinating institutional policies for scientific outreach.
* Supporting the **Transversal Training in Scientific Dissemination** (Formação Transversal).
* Organizing major institutional events, such as **UFMG Jovem**.
